</div><div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="75" height="60" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">What you call a Discerning Person has told me
that <span class="smcap">The Philistine</span> is read by all the really
thoughtful people in America. This surely is not a
large class, as I hear you print only twenty thousand
copies a month. Now I do not exactly admire your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
brown paper cover, but I do like your wholesome
spirit, and although you have a touch of Yankee
flippancy, yet I will help you all I can in clearing the
ground, that we may sow a crop worth harvesting.
And before I begin my little preachment let me say I
like the word Roycroft. “Roy” means king, and
“croft” means a home or rest—hence Roycroft
means the King’s Rest. But best of all Master Roycroft
was really the first man in England to do artistic
printing.</p>

<p>I am also told that the wives of the rich men in
the States are the most ignorant among your women;
the reason being that it takes all their time to look
after their households; and none of your servants
staying in one place longer than three weeks, that
your Woman’s Clubs are given up to discussing the
servant girl problem. That is, each woman relates
her woes to ease her nerves and fight off hysteria till
a more convenient season. And this class of care-laden
people is largely increasing with you, and yet
you continue to sing <i>Yankee Doodle</i> and talk large
about twisting the tail of an honest lion. Very well,
I pardon you, knowing how childishly ignorant you
are, and if I now say some things that I have said
before you will pardon me.</p>

<p>Observe the two opposite kinds of labor. The
first, just mentioned by me, lavishly supported by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
Capital, and producing Nothing. The second,
tramping from place to place, asking for bread, and
you giving it a stone pile—and thirty days.</p>

<p>Observe further. These two kinds of labor, producing
no useful result, are demoralizing. All such
labor is.</p>

<p>And the first condition of education, the thing
General Coxey and all of his cohorts are crying out
for, is being put to wholesome and useful work.
And it is nearly the last condition of it, too; you
need very little more; but, as things go, there will
yet be difficulty in getting that. As things have
hitherto gone, the difficulty has been to get the reverse
of that.</p>

<p>During the last eight hundred years, the upper
classes of Europe have been one large Picnic Party.
Most of them have been religious also; and in sitting
down, by companies, upon the green grass, in
parks, gardens, and the like, have considered themselves
commanded into that position by Divine
authority, and fed with bread from Heaven: of
which they considered it proper to bestow the
fragments in support, and the tithes in tuition, of the
poor.</p>

<p>But, without even such small cost, they might have
taught the poor many beneficial things. In some
places they have taught them manners, which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
already much. They might have cheaply taught them
merriment also—dancing and singing, for instance.
The young English ladies who sit nightly to be instructed
themselves, at some cost, in melodies illustrative
of the consumption of Camille, and the decline
of La Traviata, and the damnation of Don
Juan, might have taught every girl peasant in England
to join in costless choirs of innocent song.
Here and there, perhaps, a gentleman might have
been found able to teach his peasantry some science
and art. Science and fine art don’t pay; but they
cost little. Tithes—not of the income of the country,
but of the income, say, of its brewers—nay,
probably the sum devoted annually by England to
provide drugs for the adulteration of its own beer—would
have founded choice little museums, and perfect
libraries, in every village. And if here and
there an English churchman had been found (such
as Dean Stanley) willing to explain to peasants the
sculpture of his and their own cathedral, and to read
its black letter inscriptions for them; and, on warm
Sundays, when they were too sleepy to attend to
anything more proper—to tell them a story about
some of the people who had built it, or lay buried in
it—we perhaps might have been quite as religious as
we are, and yet need not now have been offering
prizes for competition in art schools, nor lecturing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
with tender sentiment on the inimitableness of the
works of Fra Angelico.</p>

<p>These things the great Picnic Party might have
taught without cost, and with amusement to themselves.
One thing, at least, they were bound to
teach, whether it amused them or not—how, day by
day, the daily bread they expected their village
children to pray to God for, might be earned in accordance
with the laws of God. This they might
have taught, not only without cost, but with gain.</p>

<p>Of all attainable liberties, then, be sure the first
to strive for is leave to be useful. Independence you
had better cease to talk of (you Americans talk too
much about it anyway), for you are dependent
on every act of what has been dust for a thousand
years, so also, does the course of a thousand
years to come, depend upon the little perishing
strength that is in you. Now what is your American
Picnic Party going to do with its leisure? On that
your fate as a Nation hangs.</p>

<p>Understand this: Virtue does not consist in doing
what will be presently paid, or even paid at all, to
you, the virtuous person. It may so chance; or may
not. It will be paid, some day; but the vital condition
of it, as virtue, is that it shall be content in its
own deed, and desirous rather that the pay of it, if
any, should be for others; just as it is also the vital<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
condition of vice to be content in its own deed, and
desirous that the pay thereof, if any, should be to
others.</p>

<p>You have, it seems, now set your little hearts much
on Education. You will have education for all men
and women now, and for all boys and girls that are
to be. Nothing, indeed, can be more desirable, if
only we determine also what kind of education they
are to have. It is taken for granted that any education
must be good; that the more of it we get, the
better; that bad education only means little education;
and that the worst thing we have to fear is getting
none. Alas, that is not at all so. Getting no
education is by no means the worst thing that can
happen to us. One of the pleasantest friends I ever
had in my life was a Savoyard guide, who could only
read with difficulty, and write, scarcely intelligibly,
and by great effort. He knew no language but his
own—no science, except as much practical agriculture
as served him to till his fields. But he was,
without exception, one of the happiest persons, and,
on the whole, one of the best I have ever known;
and after lunch, he would often as we walked up
some quiet valley in the afternoon light, give me a
little lecture on philosophy; and after I had fatigued
and provoked him with less cheerful views of the
world than his own, he would fall back to my servant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
behind me, and console himself with a shrug of the
shoulders, and a whispered “The poor child, he
doesn’t know how to live.”</p>

<p>No, my friends, believe me, it is not the going
without education at all that we have most to dread.
The real thing to be feared is getting a bad one.
There are all sorts—good, and very good; bad, and
very bad. The children of rich people often get the
worst education that is to be had for money; the
children of the poor often get the best for nothing.
And you have really these two things now to decide
for yourselves before you can take one quite safe
practical step in the matter, namely, first: What a
good education is; and, secondly, who is likely to
give it you.</p>

<p>What it is? “Everybody knows that,” I suppose
you would most of you answer. “Of course—to be
taught to read, and write, and cast accounts; and to
learn geography, and geology, and astronomy, and
chemistry, and German, and French, and Italian,
and Latin, and Greek, and the aboriginal Aryan language.”</p>

<p>Well, when you have learned all that, what would
you do next? “Next? Why then we should be
perfectly happy, and make as much money as ever
we liked, and we would turn out our toes before any
company.” I am not sure myself, and I don’t think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
you can be, of any one of these three things. At
least, as to making you very happy, I know something,
myself, of nearly all these matters—not much,
but still quite as much as most men under the ordinary
chances of life, with a fair education, are likely
to get together—and I assure you the knowledge
does not make me happy at all. When I was a boy
I used to like seeing the sunrise. I didn’t know
then, there were any spots on the sun; now I do, and
am always frightened lest any more should come.
When I was a boy, I used to care about pretty stones.
I got some Bristol diamonds at Bristol and some dog-tooth
spar in Derbyshire; my whole collection had
cost, perhaps, three half-crowns, and was worth considerably
less; and I knew nothing whatever, rightly,
about any single stone in it—could not even spell
their names; but words cannot tell the joy they used
to give me. Now, I have a collection of minerals
worth, perhaps, three thousand pounds; and I know
more about some of them than most other people.
But I am not a whit happier, either for my knowledge,
or possessions, for other geologists dispute my
theories, to my grievous indignation and discontentment;
and I am miserable about all my best specimens,
because there are better in the British Museum.</p>

<p>And as to your wonderful inventions, why talk at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
a distance, when you have nothing to say? Or go fast
from this place to that, with nothing to do at either?
These are powers certainly! Much more, power of
increased Production, if you, indeed, had got it,
would be something to boast of.</p>

<p>Now just cast your Cathode ray this way and observe
this fact: A man and a woman, with their
children, properly trained, are able easily to cultivate
as much ground as will feed them; to build as much
wall and roof as will lodge them, and to spin and
weave as much cloth as will clothe them. They can
all be perfectly happy and healthy in doing this.
Supposing that they invent machinery which will
build, plough, thresh, cook, and weave, and that
they have none of these things any more to do, but
may read, or play croquet, or cricket, all day long, I
believe myself that they will neither be so good nor
so happy as without the machines.</p>

<p>But I waive my belief in this matter for the time.
I will assume that they become more refined and
moral persons, and that idleness is in future to be the
mother of all good. But observe, I repeat, the
power of your machine is only in enabling them to
be idle. It will not enable them to live better than
they did before, nor to live in greater numbers. Get
your heads quite clear on this matter. Out of so
much ground, only so much living is to be got, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
or without machinery. You may set a million of
steam-ploughs to work on an acre, if you like—out
of that acre only a given number of grains of corn
will grow, scratch or score it as you will. So that
the question is not at all whether, by having more
machines, more of you can live. No machine will
increase the possibilities of life. It only increases
the possibilities of idleness. Suppose, for instance,
you could get the oxen on your plough driven by a
goblin, who would ask for no pay, not even his beer,—well,
your furrow will take no more seeds than if
you had held the stilts yourself. But, instead of
holding them, you sit, I presume, on a bank beside
the field, under an eglantine—watch the goblin at
his work, and read poetry. Meantime, your wife in
the house has also got a goblin to weave and wash
for her; and she is lying on the sofa, revelling in
Stephen Crane’s lines.</p>

<p>Now, as I said, I don’t believe you would be happier
so, but I am willing to believe it; only, since
you are already such brave machinists, show me at
least one or two places where you are happier. Let
me see one small example of approach to this seraphic
condition. I can show you examples, millions
of them, of happy people made happy by their own
industry. Farm after farm I can show you in Bavaria,
Switzerland, the Tyrol, and such other places,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
where men and women are perfectly happy and good,
without any iron servants. Show me, therefore,
some Kansas or Ohio family happier than these. Or
bring me—for I am not inconvincible by any kind of
evidence—bring me the testimony of an Illinois
family or two to their increased felicity. Or if you
cannot do so much as that, can you convince even
themselves of it? They are perhaps happy, if only
they knew how happy they were. Virgil thought so,
long ago, of simple rustics; but at present your
steam-propelled rustics are crying out that they are
anything else than happy, and that they regard their
boasted progress “in the light of a monstrous
Sham.”</p>

<p>There are three Material things, not only useful,
but essential to Life. No one knows how to live till
he has got them.</p>

<p>These are, Pure Air, Water and Earth.</p>

<p>There are three Immaterial things, not only useful,
but essential to Life. No one knows how to live till
he has got them also.</p>

<p>These are, Admiration, Hope and Love.</p>

<p>Admiration—the power of discerning and taking
delight in what is beautiful in visible Form, and
lovely in human Character; and, necessarily, striving
to produce what is beautiful in form, and to become
what is lovely in character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>Hope—the recognition, by true Foresight, of better
things to be reached hereafter, whether by ourselves
or others; necessarily issuing in the straightforward
and undisappointable effort to advance, according
to our proper power, the gaining of them.</p>

<p>Love, both of family and neighbor, faithful, and
satisfied.</p>

<p>These are the six chiefly useful things to be got by
Political Economy—the great “savoir mourir” is
doing with them.</p>

<p>The first three, I said, are Pure Air, Water, and
Earth.</p>

<p>Heaven gives you the main elements of these.
You can destroy them at your pleasure, or increase,
almost without limit, the available quantities of
them.</p>

<p>You can vitiate the air by your manner of life, and
of death, to any extent. You might easily vitiate it
so as to bring such a pestilence on the globe as
would end all of you. Some of you Jingo Americans
at present want to vitiate it in every direction;—chiefly
with corpses, and animal and vegetable
ruin in war: changing men, horses, and garden-stuff
into noxious gas. But everywhere, and all day long,
you are vitiating it with foul chemical exhalations;
and the horrible nests, which you call towns, Buffalo,
Pittsburg, Chicago and the like (thank God I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
been in none of them), are little more than laboratories
for the distillation into heaven of venomous
smokes and smells, mixed with effluvia from decaying
animal matter, and infectious miasmata from
purulent disease.</p>

<p>On the other hand, your power of purifying the
air, by dealing properly and swiftly with all substances
in corruption; by absolutely forbidding noxious manufactures;
and by planting in all soils the trees which
cleanse and invigorate earth and atmosphere—is literally
infinite. You might make every breath of air
you draw, food.</p>

<p>Secondly, your power over the rain and rain-waters
of the earth is infinite. You can bring rain where
you will, by planting wisely and tending carefully—drought,
where you will, by ravage of woods and
neglect of the soil. You might have the rivers as
pure as the crystal of the rock; beautiful in falls, in
lakes, in living pools—so full of fish that you might
take them out with your hands. Or you may do always
as you have done now, turn your rivers into a
common sewer, so that you cannot as much as baptize
a Yankee baby but with filth, unless you hold its
face out in the rain; and even that falls dirty.</p>

<p>Then for the third, Earth—meant to be nourishing
for you, and blossoming—you have used your scientific
hands and scientific brains, inventive of explosive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
and deathful things, to make it grow cotton and
tobacco, and grain for malt and whiskey, giving
nothing back to the earth that she may be blossoming
and life-giving. Yes, you have turned the Mother-Earth,
Demeter, into the Avenger-Earth, Tisiphone—with
the voice of your brother’s blood crying out
of it, in one wild cry round all its murderous sphere.</p>

<p>That is what you have done for the three Material
Useful Things.</p>

<p>Then for the three Immaterial Useful Things. For
admiration, you have learned contempt and conceit.
There is no lovely thing ever yet done by man that
you care for, or can understand; but you are persuaded
you are able to do much finer things yourselves.
You gather, and exhibit together, as if
equally instructive, what is infinitely bad, with what
is infinitely good. You do not know which is which:
most Americans instinctively prefer the bad, and do
more of it. You instinctively hate the Good, and
destroy it.</p>

<p>Then, secondly, for Hope. You have not so much
spirit of it in you as to begin any plan which will not
pay for ten years; nor so much intelligence of it in
you (either politicians or workmen) as to be able
to form one clear idea of what you would like your
country to become.</p>

<p>Then, thirdly, for Love. You were ordered by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
the Founder of your religion to love your neighbor
as yourselves. But you have framed an entire
Science of Political Economy, founded on rivalry and
strife, which is what you have stated to be the constant
instinct of man—the desire to overreach his
neighbor.</p>

<p>And you have driven your women so that they ask
no more for Love, nor for fellowship with you; but
stand against you, and ask for “justice.”</p>

<p>Are there any of you who are tired of all this?</p>

<p>Well then try to make some small piece of ground
beautiful, peaceful, and fruitful. We will have no
untended or unthought-of creatures on it; none
wretched, but the sick; none idle, but the dead. We
will have no liberty upon it; but instant obedience to
known law, and appointed persons; no equality upon
it, but recognition of every good that we can find.
We will have plenty of flowers and vegetables in our
gardens, plenty of corn and grass in our fields. We
will have some music and some poetry; the children
shall learn to dance it and sing—perhaps some of
the old people, in time, may also. We will have
some art, moreover pictures and hand-made books;
we will at least try if, like the Greeks, we can’t make
pottery. The Greeks used to paint pictures of
gods on their pots; we, probably, cannot do as
much, but we may put some pictures of flowers—butterflies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
and frogs, if nothing better. Little by
little, some higher art and imagination may manifest
themselves among us; and feeble rays of science
may dawn for us. Botany, though too dull to dispute
the existence of flowers; and history, though too simple
to question the nativity of men; nay—even perhaps
an uncalculating and uncovetous wisdom, as of
rude Magi, presenting, at such nativity, gifts of gold
and frankincense.</p>

<p>“My wife? She is dead!” said the man.</p>

<p>“God help you to bear it,” were the answering
words of the woman.</p>

<p>“And you would have me do my duty?”</p>

<p>“You could do naught else. There are other
things than love, my friend; there is honor, and we
must abide by that—and the inevitable.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“I am the resurrection and the life saith the Lord;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
he that believeth in me though he were dead yet
shall he live: and whosoever believeth in me, shall
never die.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The last friend had paid his final tribute to the departed.
All had gone save the husband, his little
daughter, the mother—and a woman simply clad in
black. Her face was pale, marked by delicate
traceries of mental suffering—a suffering so intense
that the whole contour was radiant with martyrdom
and the inner spiritual beauty of her woman’s
soul. Her eyes, earth brown and blazing with the
hidden sunlight of her year’s sad spring, were fixed
in mute appeal upon the still, white face within its
house of immortality.</p>

<p>It was the husband now, who, taking her gently
by the hand, lead her to the carriage.</p>

<p>Was it “kismet” that, by some grim coincidence,
placed these two human, saddened souls in the same
carriage—alone!</p>

<p>The way was long, and the roads as yet unsoftened
by the Spring’s nestling bloom. For a while neither
spoke, and then the woman’s voice vibrated through
the silence like a breath of air light as the apple
blossoms caroling in May, when leaf and bud unite
in song to praise their creator.</p>

<p>“Dear, you and I are soon to say good bye; by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
some strange fateful turn of Life’s orbit, we must say
it here. You were always generous and loyal to her—you
always will be. She has forgiven you, but bids
me lead my life alone. The voice of circumstance
says to us what we interpret it to say. It is in the
needs of a high nature wherein doth lie nobility
and honor. We loved; it was so to be, but we did
not sin; therein lies the truest and purest love.
You”——</p>

<p>The carriage stopped before the open grave, and
as the woman watched the damp earth fall—kneeling,
she dropped a single passion flower upon the coffin’s
lid, and through her mist of tears beheld the cross;
then murmuring “In His Name,” she entered the
carriage—alone!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AS_TO_BORES">AS TO BORES.</h2>

</div>

<p>A little while ago I read in a paper the following
scathing paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There is nothing so terrible as to be fairly well informed
on a subject and have some unutterable bore
come around and insist on pouring into your ear a
mass of ill-digested misinformation on that subject.</p>

</div>

<p>This looks profoundly, dismally true. It undoubtedly
is. No, there is one thing more terrible,
and that is to be conscious of being the bore.</p>

<p>The boree has been heard from frequently since the
Renaissance, and his sentiments have undergone little
change. The borer hasn’t had much to say for himself.
Yet who can place his hand upon his heart
and assert that he has never experienced what it is to
be one? To have to be the victim of such, dear sir,
is the payment the gods exact for the treasure of extraordinary
learning. Nobody has a monopoly of
advanced knowledge on this planet, but most of us
are born ignorant and remain so until by the grace
of heaven we become bores. The state of borehood
is the chrysalis stage of the human intelligence, intermediate
between grub and butterfly. The apple-borer
has such a stage, so has the ordinary unqualified
borer of urban life. He has eaten his modicum
of the tough, indigestible portion of the tree of
knowledge, and must undergo metamorphosis before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
sipping the nectar of its fruit. The writer of my
text may be an exception to this generalization, for
clearly he never advanced from ignorance through
the purgatory of borehood to celestial learning, or he
would know how terrible it is to be an unutterable bore.</p>

<p>Alas, poor bore! Will nobody pray for you, or
drop a pitying tear?</p>

<p>The bore we have always with us. He who would
enjoy his superior culture in immunity from the
eleemosynary appeals of spiritual mendicants should
go into the desert and become a hermit and learn to
say like the hermit in Homo Sum, nihil humanum
alienum me puto. I do suspect, though, that the
saint in question himself fled into the desert to avoid
a bore. And that reminds me that a saint of my acquaintance
was once called upon to help one of these
spiritual apple-borers through the tough integuments
of a theological cocoon. He received a visit from
the painful creature about every day. How unutterably
it must have bored him! But he never said so.
At last the poor bore achieved wings and flew away
into a Universalist orchard; and as there are few
things about which people in general know so much
that ain’t so as they do about the subject on which
he is now well posted, he probably realizes how terrible
it is to be the victim of the morally dyspeptic,
misinformed or uninformed, unutterable bore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>But the man who has a mission to mankind can’t
afford to be bored. Jesus Christ, who was, if anybody
ever was, born with fine intuitions, on some
subjects, that transcended any laboriously acquired
knowledge, must have been the worst bored man in
Palestine when his disciples came around and asked
him such questions as who should be first in the
kingdom of heaven, or the Sadducees propounded
that conundrum about the woman with seven husbands.
But instead of putting his unutterable boredom
on record in a crisp text he answered their irritating
questions in that sweetly wise way of his,
which must, if anything could, have caused those
poor souls to sprout wings.</p>

<p>He also said, whatsoever we would that men should
do to us, we ought to do to them; and did not except
bores.</p>

<p>All animals having the cloven hoof chew a cud.

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=" "> The loyalty of men to their Alma Mater is ever
charming, but the loyalty of a youth to his prospective
Mother-in-Law is sublime. In the past two weeks
every mail has brought me letters from Harvard men
protesting against a certain preachment that appeared
in the May <span class="smcap">Philistine</span> entitled, “By Rule of Three.”
For the most part the literary style of these missives
corroborates the strictures made as to English as she
is writ at Harvard. But the crowning feature of the
paper fusilade is a foolscap proposition signed by
four sophomores wherein they offer to put the author
of “By Rule of Three” under the pump if he will
name a day and hour when he dare walk across Harvard
Yard. The author, I believe, is not a Baptist,
but even if he were, and if the rite referred to should
be performed (in lieu of argument), why, Barrett
Wendell would still be an Anglomaniac and the facts
about English at Harvard would remain unchanged!</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=" "> Mr. S. E. Kiser, that good honest Wit, writes me
after this wise:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>At present not more than three out of every possible
five persons to be met in this country are possessed
of the honest conviction that Nature intended them
for dalliance with the Muse.</p>

<p>Why does this deplorable state of affairs exist?
The answer is not far to seek. We do not give our
poets enough encouragement. On the contrary,
there seems to be a widespread conspiracy to keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
them down. Every time champing Pegasus is
mounted by a new aspirant you may see a score of
critics flirt their lassoos at him, with the hope of
yanking him from his perch; unless, perchance, he
be an adept in the Free Masonry that occasionally
exempts some favored one from the onslaughts of the
iconoclasts.</p>

<p>To come to a case in point, <i>Duncey’s</i> endeavors to
dispose of a few bards who are presumed to have
furnished Uncle Frank’s critic with complimentary
volumes of their own make. One of them, a Mr.
W. B. Yeats, is taken to task for asserting that
“Down by the salley gardens he and his love did
meet.” The salley garden is objected to, forsooth,
upon the ground that nobody but the inventor knows
what it is. Here is a fine proposition! What would
some of our most prosperous bards amount to in the
estimation of the public if their verses were always
couched in terms that anybody could understand?
In the very number of the magazine that contains the
raillery against Mr. Yeats’ salley garden, Samuel
Minturn Peck warbles in this wise:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I’m dreaming of the fragrant South,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My native pine clad hills afar;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I seem to feel upon my mouth</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The sweetness of a jasmine star!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon time and space are vanished,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And leagues on leagues away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With every grief far banished,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My aching heart is hay.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This, it is fair to presume, was paid for “at the
regular rates” for such matter, and published as an
example of praiseworthy song, notwithstanding the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
fact that mighty few of <i>Duncey’s</i> million subscribers
could depose and say whether a jasmine star is sweet
or sour, or whether it would be necessary, in order to
get the full benefit of its flavor, to peel it and slice it
as one would an apple, or suck it like a lemon. It
would also be difficult to explain to the satisfaction
of a hypercritical person why, “with every grief far
banished,” any one could have the faintest shadow
of an excuse for possessing an aching heart; or, that
point cleared up, how the aching heart aforesaid
could still be timothy. But these are trifles that
ought not to be permitted to embarrass the sweet
singer. I mention them only to illustrate the unfairness
with which Mr. Yeats has been treated. Mr.
Peck is in vogue, to a certain extent, while Mr.
Yeats is not. Ergo: Yeats and his muse must not
fool around in the salley garden.</p>

<p>This matter disposed of, Sophie M. Almon-Hensley
is chided for asseverating that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My ship’s in the bay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The glad, blue bay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wind’s from the west,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the waves have a crest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But my bird’s in the nest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And my ship’s in the bay.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“It must,” says <i>Duncey’s</i> astute critic, “be a
consolation to the writer of these inspired lines to
know that her various possessions are where they belong.
After all, there is nothing like having a place
for everything and everything in its place.” Which
may be witty as well as true, but why ridicule Sophie
M. Almon-Hensley on one page and on the next
laud Robert Louis Stevenson—God rest his soul—for
such verses as these:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Through all the pleasant meadow side</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The grass grew shoulder high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the shining scythes went far and wide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And cut it down to dry.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">These green and sweetly smelling crops</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They led in wagons home,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and so on. No one is likely to suppose for a moment
that the scythes went up and down, or that the grass
was cut up to soak, or that the green and sweetly
smelling crops were led away from home in top buggies.
Yet, from an artistic standpoint, Stevenson
was justified in acquainting us with the details of the
operation, which fact makes the attack upon Sophie
M. Almon-Hensley particularly aggravating.</p>

<p>The truth seems to be that a large majority of the
publishers do not like the idea of breeding up a new
race of poets. Those who are already in the field
must be tolerated, and those who are well dead may
be quoted <i>ad. lib.</i> without fear of the copyright law.
It is gratifying to note one shining exception to this
rule. The editor of the transitory <i>Chip-Munk</i> has
evidently determined to publish anything and everything
in the shape of verse that falls into his hands.
This, if not actually announced, is clearly implied in
his Easter number, where, among other things, are
to be found these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Or there, or here, to toil or pleasure led,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tenants pass, and cut each other dead;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jones, second floor, administers affronts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Because his father was a governor once.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After this, the amateur may comfort himself with
the assurance that he has at least one friend, with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
helping hand outstretched. While young Mr. Bumball’s
paper, ink and type hold out, there is no reason
why every state, every county, every town and
every hamlet may not have a rhymesmith of its very
own. This is encouraging, and leads to the hope
that in time, if the brood of the mother hen keeps
on increasing, it may come to pass that he who runs
may rhyme and get his rhyme in print.</p>
